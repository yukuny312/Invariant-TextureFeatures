# Gray Level Invariant Texture Features

## Overview
The key contributions of this work: 

(1) Extend the normalization method to texture features in GLCM, GLSZM, GLRLM, GLDM and NGTDM.

(2) Compare the invariant texture feature properties derived from the normalization factor method with the well-defined Haralick method.

(3) Analyze the invariance of texture features using statistical measurement and visualized characterized map.

(4) Investigate the application of invariant texture features for image classification.

(5) Compare the results of binary classification between the invariant texture feature model and the deep learning neural network architecture, ResNet50.
